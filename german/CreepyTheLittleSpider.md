=========================

The little spider sits in her first self-spun web and ponders.
She thinks and thinks and thinks some more. Then suddenly, she decidedly makes her way...

to her Mama.

###

"Mama?," asks the little spider,
"Why are people afraid of us?"
"How did you come up with that?," asks Mama, surprised.

"Well as people came past my web today, they loudly screamed 'Eeeew! Creepy!!!!' and
ran away," answered the little spider with disappointment.

"You know, Precious," says Mama with sympathy, "many questions are not so easy to answer. But a clever spider asks many questions and then makes her own opinion."

>>Hmmm...<<< thinks the little spider. Then she has an idea and joyfully makes her way...

to Uncle Longlegs.

###

Uncle Longlegs is actually Uncle Oskar.
But everyone calls him Uncle Longlegs because he has long legs.

"Uncle Longlegs, why are people afraid of us?," asks the little spider.

Uncle Longlegs laughs. "That's simple!," he says. "They can not understand how we run
so elegantly with our eight legs! They just stumble around on their two legs."

>>That's why the are afraid of us?<< wonders the little spider and continued to on
her way...

to her Cousin Punky.

###

Punky no longer lives in a web like the other spiders.
