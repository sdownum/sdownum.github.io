### Raspberry Pi Rust Cross-Compile under Windows
*13 Feb 2017*

@japaric has a great overview of Rust cross-compilation over at this repo: https://github.com/japaric/rust-cross. Not only does it have a comprehensive text on the subject, it has a "TL;DR" version to answer th important question "I'm an Ubuntu user. What is the quickest setup for me?" Minutes later, this user is cross-compiling Rust source for targets running Linux under ARMv7.

Some days, I have to switch between Ubuntu and Windows workstations for one reason or another. I'd like 


```
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
```
